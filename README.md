# Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse
This is a program created using a handtracking module I created from mediapipes solutions. The program finds your hand and draws all landmarks. To use the
mouse simply put your pointer finger up to move the mouse around the frame and if you want to click put both your pointer and middle fingers up and put them together.

## Usage
To use this program you need to install the required packages and have a screen open where you can click around.
When you are ready to run enter this command:
```sh
python3 virt_mouse.py
```
Then put your hand in view of the camera and move your pointer around to move the mouse and put the pointer and middler up and together to click!
